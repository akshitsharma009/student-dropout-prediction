# Student Dropout Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting student performance and dropout risk using machine learning.
By analyzing academic, behavioral, and demographic data, the system helps identify students who
may require early academic intervention.

## Problem Statement
Student dropout is a major challenge for educational institutions and often goes unnoticed
until it is too late. Manual monitoring makes early identification difficult, especially when
handling large volumes of student data.

## Objective
- Analyze student academic and behavioral data
- Build a machine learning model to predict dropout risk
- Provide insights to support data-driven intervention

## Why This Project Matters
Early identification of at-risk students can help institutions improve retention rates,
academic performance, and overall student success.
